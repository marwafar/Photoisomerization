Quantum dynamics of the photoisomeriation of Rhodopsin embeded in an optical cavity.
The molecular model consists of two electronic states and the reaction coordinate 
is coupled to a single cavity mode via the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian.

initial-wf.py: compute the initial wavefunction.
propagation-1D-cavity.py: propagate the wavefunction in time using the numerically exact method.
