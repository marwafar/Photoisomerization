a) initial-wf.py: compute the initial wavefunction
b) propagation.py: propagate the wavefunction and exports:
1- The population of the electronic states population in the adiabatic representation.
2- The population of the electronic states population in the diabatic representation.
3- The probability of cis and trans isomers in the adiabatic ground and excited state.
