The coordinate: \theta is the isomerization coordinate and X is the coupling coordinate which couple the two electronic states. 
a) initial-wf.py: compute the initial wavefunction Psi(\theta,X,t_0). 
b) propagation.py: Computes the wavefunction Psi(theta,X,t) at each time step by solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and exports the time evolution of:
1- The population of the electronic states population in the adiabatic representation.
2- The population of the electronic states population in the diabatic representation.
3- The probability of cis and trans isomers in the adiabatic ground and excited state.
