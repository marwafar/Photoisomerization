Quantum dynamics of the photoisomerization of Rh in field-free space. The model consists of two 
electronic states and two degrees of freedom 
(the isomerization coordinate (\theta) and the C=C stretch (x)).

a) initial-wf.py: compute the initial wavefunction Psi(\theta,x,t_0). 
b) propagation.py: Computes the wavefunction Psi(theta,x,t) at each time step 
by solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation numerically exact 
and exports the time evolution of:
1- The population of the electronic states in the adiabatic representation.
2- The population of the electronic states in the diabatic representation.
3- The probability of cis and trans isomers in the adiabatic ground and excited state.
